## -48 Calculator Help

> The -48 Calculator APP can store your Gematria Phrases if you choose to save those phrases. You also have the option of not saving anything at all by never clicking on the SAVE Folder. If you do choose to save phrases, the phrases are stored on your device, and optionally in the Apple iCloud if you've enabled the iCloud SAVE/BACKUP feature for Apple APPS. Only you can see your phrases, they are not accessible by anyone else.
>
> Apple requires a Privacy policy for all APPS that are accepted into the App Store. The policy for the -48 Calculator, can be reviewed here - https://n48calculator.github.io/policy/.
>
> When the APP is started for the first time, it starts in "training mode" to assist you in learning the various features of the Calculator. Suggestions are made that are focused around you and your interests so that you can eventually see your own personal corrolations in Gematria. However, you can choose to type in anything you want instead during the training and ignore all suggestions offered by the APP during "training".
>
> You also have the option to bypass "training" completely using an ESCAPE code of "**BQQM!**" (that's 5 characters without the quotes), typed into the Calculator phrase entry area.

## Demonstration Videos

The following links are to a handful of social media pages that contain some short demonstration videos of the Calculator in operation for users that don't know where to begin. You should be able to find the demo videos "pinned" to the Top of these page links.

In the near future, there will be some LIVE sessions for Q&A and for additional Feature demonstrations.
